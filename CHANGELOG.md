## 2.0.0 - [Unreleased]

Major changes to the previous unreleased version to bring everything up to date
with the latest versions of PHP, PSR-7, and PHPUnit.

### Added

- Add "Dockerfile", "docker-compose.yml", and ".dockerignore" files to create a standardized isolated development
  environment for contributors.
- Add support for PHP 8.1, 8.2, and 8.2
- Add missing code coverage for `StreamWrapper::tell()`
- A Makefile was added for easier management of common tasks such as cleaning build artifacts, starting a bash shell in
  the development container, running tests, rectifying code style issues, and running PHPStan code analysis.
- Standardized editor configuration was added via ".editorconfig" which automatically sets up indentation, character
  set, and trimming options for the supported types of files.
- Add and configure PHPStan as a project development dependency, updating code to pass at max level
- Add and configure Rector as a project development dependency, running the applicable standard rule sets
- Add SECURITY.md file
- Add CHANGELOG.md file
- Add CONTRIBUTORS.md file
- Add other standard project skeleton files, including ".gitattributes" and ".gitignore"'

### Changed

- Dependency on `psr/http-message` package updated to "^1.0 || ^2.0"
- Return and parameter types have been defined where possible, and in compliance with the PSR-7 "static" return

  max settings
